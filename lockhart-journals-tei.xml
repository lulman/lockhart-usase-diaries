                        unlined margins. The body of the pages contains 28 horizontal blue lines spaced 0.8 cm apart and a vertical red line defining
                        a 2.54 cm left margin. Some pages contain all or part of a 10 x 7.4 cm oval watermark depicting a seated female figure 
                        holding a spear in the crook of her right arm and leaves in her extended left hand. A 3 x 5 cm crown sits above the oval.

                        of outgoing messages. The incoming radiograms are all on cream-colored onionskin measuring 20.2 cm wide by 13.5 cm tall with two spiral binding 
                        holes along one edge (in all but one case at the top of the message). The outgoing messages are on heavier cream-colored paper, most 
                        measuring 21.6 cm wide by 14 cm tall except for three from April 1941 measuring 21.5 cm wide by 17.6 cm tall.

                  <note type="biographical">H. Lewis Ulman is Associate Professor of English at The Ohio State
                     University and Director of Digital Media Studies in the Department of English.
                     He has edited <title level="m">The Minutes of the Aberdeen Philosophical Society, 1758–1773</title>
                     (Aberdeen University Press, 1990) and, with Dennis Quon, “Semiotics in
                     Eighteenth-century Aberdeen: Thomas Gordon’s Contributions to the Aberdeen
                     Philosophical Society” (<title level="m">Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth-Century</title> 317
                     (1994): 57–115). He is also the author of <title level="m">Things, Thoughts, Words and Actions:
                     The Problem of Language in Late Eighteenth-Century British Rhetorical Theory</title>
                     (Southern Illinois University Press, 1994). Since 2005, he has worked with
                     undergraduate and graduate students in textual editing courses to create a
                     series of electronic textual editions of nineteenth- and early
                     twentieth-century American manuscripts in the Rare Books and Manuscripts
                     Library at Ohio State. An example of that work can be viewed online at
                     http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/ulman1/SSCoxJournal/. Beginning with an NEH
                     Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant awarded in 2008, he has collaborated with
                     Melanie Schlosser, metadata librarian at Ohio State University Libraries, to
                     build a model of preservation for distributed, multimodal digital humanities
                     projects. He is delighted to be working at a time when manuscript, print, and
                     digital media can be studied in relationship to one another, allowing him and
                     his students to learn more about all three media than they could by studying
                     any one in isolation.</note>

            <p>This edition is the latest in a series of collaboratively produced electronic
               editions of previously unpublished nineteenth-century American manuscripts held in
               the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at The Ohio State University. Previous
               editions include "My Dear Elizabeth," five letters written by Sophia Peabody
               Hawthorne to her sister Elizabeth Palmer Peabody between ca. 1837 and 1868 (currently
               being revised); "Dear Wife," twenty-one letters written by riverboat captain William
               B. Anderson to his wife Louisa while he plied the Ohio river during the height of the
               American Civil War, 1862&#x2013;1864; "Journal of a Tour to Europe," by Samuel Sullivan Cox;
               and "Louisa A. Doane's Journal of Two Ocean Voyages (1852-1853). These documentary
               editions are intended to provide wide exposure and access to manuscripts that might
               otherwise be difficult for scholars to discover and consult, and to provide users
               with a variety of tools for studying those texts. </p>
            <p>Each text was edited in connection with an undergraduate or graduate course offered
               by H. Lewis Ulman, Associate Professor of English at The Ohio State University. The
               courses provide students with an opportunity to explore issues of textuality
               and mediation that arise when our cultural archives spread from page to screen and
               from library shelves to networked databases. Electronic textual editing serves as our
               vehicle for examining what happens—and envisioning what might happen—when artifacts
               in one medium are represented in another medium, especially with regard to the
               interpretive work of reading. Electronic textual editions also provide a contact zone
               that can help us reflect on what manuscript, print, and "born digital" artifacts can
               tell us about their unique properties and their relationships to one another.</p>
            <p>While providing a reliable textual edition is a <foreign xml:lang="lat">sine qua
                  non</foreign>, the Lockhart edition also explores ways of telling four stories
               inextricably woven into our work: the lives and historical milieu evoked by the
               texts, the history of the physical journal, the
               editorial process that gave rise to this particular interpretation of the text, and
               the mediation of our electronic delivery system. </p>

               <emph rend="bold">Scanning</emph>. The manuscript pages were scanned as 24-bit TIFF
               images at 400 dots per inch (dpi), then coverted to 8-bit JPEG images at 400 dpi and
               full quality before being loaded into the Media Manager application. All edges were
               overscanned by at least 1/4 inch. No color correction was used at any stage of image
               preparation, but a scan of a photographer's 18% grey card on the same scanner
               produced RGB values at the center of 91/95/107 after applying a 150% Gaussian Blur in
               Adobe Photoshop to average color values. Thus, a properly configured monitor should
               provide a reasonable approximation of colors on the manuscript pages.

               element, are the primary physical structures represented in the markup. Each
               &lt;pb&gt; element includes a &quot;facs&quot; attribute identifying the unique ID of
               a high-resolution scan of that image in the Media Manager application. <emph
                  rend="bold">Line breaks</emph> (i.e., lineation determined or influenced by the
               physical constraints of the page rather than compositional choices by the author) are
               encoded with the empty &lt;lb/&gt; element. No attributes are included in the
               &lt;lb&gt; element. Because Smith wrote on lined paper, when he skips a line printed
               on the paper for any reason, we encode a &lt;lb/&gt; that, in the view arranged by
               manuscript pages and lines, will appear as an empty numbered line. </p>

               <emph rend="bold">Markup of Textual Structure</emph>. The <emph rend="bold">diary
                  entry</emph>, encoded by a &lt;div&gt; element with the attribute-value pair
               &quot;type='Entry'&quot;, constitutes the primary textual structure represented in
               the markup. Each entry contains a
               &lt;dateline&gt; element and one or more paragraphs. Each dateline may include a
               &lt;name&gt; element with (optionally) a @type attribute containing one of
               the following values: city, region; and a &lt;date&gt; element with a
               @when attribute whose value is in the form YYYY-MM-DD. The value of the
               @when attribute represents the editors' judgment about the actual date when the entry
               was composed; the contents of the &lt;date&gt; element represent what Smith actually
               wrote, even if he entered the date incorrectly.
            </p>
            <p>
               Entries consist of a series of <emph rend="bold">paragraphs</emph>. Where indicated
               by context, indentation of a line from the left margin of a page, line breaks part-way across
               a page, or additional white space between lines, paragraphs are encoded with the
               &lt;p&gt; element and no attributes.
            </p>
            <p>
               If present, any prefatory text preceding the dateline may be encoded as a
               &lt;head&gt; element at the beginning of an entry (i.e., within the
               &lt;div&gt;element and before the &lt;dateline&gt;).

               <emph rend="bold">Level of Transcription/Encoding</emph>. This markup scheme supports
               a modest range of presentations, from semi-modernized/corrected to semi-diplomatic.
               The basic transcription follows the manuscript verbatim. Various manuscript features
               (e.g., cancellations, interlinear or marginal additions, tears in pages) are encoded,
               as are regularized versions of proper names and dates and standard versions of
               nonstandard spellings and expansions of abbreviations. </p>

                  <lb/>At the exact moment when christmas bells should have
                  <lb/>begun ringing here in the <placeName>Antarctic</placeName> if any christmas bells
                  <lb/>had been available, <persName><unclear>Pack</unclear></persName> <persName>Jack</persName> <persName>Tony</persName> and I were making
                  <lb/>our last big "Putsch" toward <rs>the base</rs> We had left
                  <lb/><placeName>Fort Wiener</placeName> at 930 PM and at 11 PM when we were
                  <lb/>only 10.5 miles from <rs>the base</rs> decided not to camp until
                  <lb/>morning but push on in. <del rend="strikethrough">Tony and the <unclear>rest</unclear></del> While we were
                  <lb/>resting we drank a toast to ourselves — as a party — and
                  <lb/>to a merry christmas, finishing up the half a pint which
                  <lb/>I had nursed along so carefully for two and a half months. <persName>Tony</persName>
                  <lb/>and I started out again and again and for a while had some
                  <lb/>difficulty staying ahead of the dogs. They were running now
                  <lb/>just as well as they did when we first hit the good
                  <lb/>surface we were travelling over. <persName>Jack</persName> and <persName><unclear>Sevene</unclear></persName> still
                  <lb/>combining new teams and he was driving them. <persName>Dinch</persName> and
                  <lb/><persName>Pearl</persName> were pinched up in the loads. I am quite certain
                  <lb/>that we should never have made the base when we did
                  <lb/>if we hadn't combinded our teams. At one o'clock we
                  <lb/>could just see the base and the airplane looming on the
                  <lb/>horizon. <persName>Tony</persName> had been seeing things for several hours
                  <lb/>but always he had to say <said aloud= "true" direct= "true">I guess I was wrong</said>
                  <lb/>when a large trail flag <del rend= "strikethrough"><unclear cert="high">br</unclear></del> came into view. All sorts
                  <lb/>of thoughts began clicking through our minds as the base
               
               <pb facs= "journal-2-06.jpg"/>
                  <fw type="pageNum" place="top">2</fw>
           
              <lb/>became larger and larger. <persName>Tony</persName><del rend= "strikethrough"><unclear cert="high">br</unclear></del>, I know, was especially
              <lb/>anxious to get into the barracks to tell his stories. The
              <lb/>rest of us were wondering what the present set up was like-
              <lb/>we had heard so many reports while we were out on the trail
              <lb/>that we had no idea what we were walking into. I
              <lb/>think the thought uppermost in our minds was food. While
              <lb/>we were out on the trail we were perfectly satisfied with our
              <lb/>somewhat rigid diet but now that we were approaching some-
              <lb/>thing of quite different. I said that I probable wouldn't eat very much
              <lb/><unclear cert="medium">Peuk</unclear> said he would eat only a ham sandwich and a cup of coffee.
              <lb/><persName>Tony</persName>and<persName>Jack</persName> said they were going to fill up. We all had our
              <lb/>doubts whether <persName>Gutenko</persName> would have anything for us.
              </p>
              <p>
                 <lb/>When we had come about 2 miles from the base,<persName>Tony</persName>
                 <lb/>and I stopped <persName>Jack</persName> who was leading and suggested that we
                 <lb/>let <persName><unclear cert="medium">Peuk</unclear></persName> take his team in first. <persName>Tony</persName> skied ahead breaking
                 <lb/>trail with <persName><unclear cert="medium">Peuk</unclear></persName> following a short distance behind I skied
                 <lb/>ahead of old <persName>Spot</persName>.<persName>Paul</persName> came out to meet us and gave
                 <lb/>us a good hand clapp as we came up to him. There was
                 <lb/>preliminary gossip as we endrived in. We parked in
                 <lb/>front of the balloon house where we were met by almost the
                 <lb/>whole camp personnel. We had been wondering whether any
                 <lb/>but a dozen few would be waiting up for us and now were
                 <lb/>surprised to see everyone. While we were answering various
                 <lb/>questions we net up camp and staked out the dogs. <persName>Douglas</persName>
                 <lb/>and <persName>Wiener</persName> hauled over some seal meat they had cut. The
                 <lb/>dogs sure enjoyed it and then yelped for more. By that time
                 <lb/><persName>Gutenko</persName> said that <unclear>clun</unclear> was nearly ready and we all <unclear cert="medium">repaired</unclear> to
              
               <pb facs="journal-2-07.jpg"/>
               <fw type="pageNum" place="top">3</fw>
               
                  <lb/>the barracks. We took our clothes off and weighed in.
                  <lb/><persName>Peuk</persName> weighed 193 before and 173 after (in same clothes) <persName>Jack</persName>
                  <lb/>weighed 159 before and about 158 after. <persName>Tony</persName> weighed 189
                  <lb/>before and 163 after I weighed 162 before and 150 after.
                  <lb/>Those of us who lost weight lost only the fat that we had
                  <lb/>put on during the winter night. <persName ref="#Gutenko">Gutenko</persName> really put out a
                  <lb/>meal. tomato juice, tomato soup steak potatoes and even
                  <lb/>figs for dessert and coffee. I really ate my share thus
                  <lb/>not living up to the statement I made on the trail. We
                  <lb/>had come in at 2AM having covered the 34 miles in less
                  <lb/>than 16 hours which was very good time considering the stops
                  <lb/>we made, this surface and the condition we and the dogs
                  <lb/>were in. Then we sat around and talked for several more
                  <lb/>hours. <persName>Jack</persName> and I went out to sleep in the tent but <persName>Tony</persName>
                  <lb/>and <persName>Peuk</persName> stayed inside. It was almost six oclock before
                  <lb/>we got out there <persName>Arnold</persName> came out with us and fed us with
                  <lb/>some of the dish and there was a lot of it.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <lb/>I slept the sleep of the blessed for about three hours and
                  <lb/>then dozed for about three hours <del rend="strikethrough"><unclear cert="low">f</unclear></del> more. <persName>Jack</persName> and <persName>Doug</persName>
                  <lb/>talking in the next tent convinced me that it was time to get
                  <lb/>up. after dressing I went into the galley to have my first
                  <lb/>different breakfast in several months. There was fruit toast
                  <lb/>cheeze and coffee and I had pleanty of all. From then
                  <lb/>on I spent the time until dinner cleaning up a little and
                  <lb/>chewing the fat a lot. The dinner was one of the <persName ref="#Gutenko">Gutenko's</persName> specials
                  <lb/>turkey with sweet potatoes asparagus spinach
                  <lb/>dressing cranberry sauce after <unclear cert="medium">boullim</unclear>; we had a little

                     <lb/>christmas spirit and strawberry pie to top things off then
                     <lb/>more <unclear>lulling</unclear> until show time. We saw the <title level="m" ref="#jfih">Jones family in
                        <lb/>Hollywood</title> and <title level="m" ref="#rb">Risky Business</title>. I enjoyed both of them.

                  <p>
                     <lb/>It had been blowing about 35-40 miles an hour all day
                     <lb/>and drifting so badly that I decided to sleep in. <persName>Jack</persName> 
                     <lb/>however braved the storm and slept out. <del rend="strikethrough">All in</del>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    <lb/>All in all this has by far been the most eventful
                    <lb/>christmas I have ever experienced. 
                 </p>
                  <p>
                     <lb/>The base has been operating on a very peculiar schedule 
                     <lb/>since the trail parties went out. <persName ref="#Gutenko">Gutenko</persName> gets up about 1-2
                     <lb/>PM and works preparing the only meal of the day a dinner
                     <lb/>The rest of the men get up anytime between 2 and 6 and then 
                     <lb/>stay up until they get tired enough to go to bed again about
                     <lb/>6-7-8 in the morning. The only work being done around camp
                     <lb/>is general duty and evacuation work- not much of the latter
                     <lb/>as yet. The camp is divided into two groups each of which
                     <lb/>does the cleaning up and galley duty in alternate days. In  
                     <lb/>off moments the fellows go skiing and walking with the dogs.
                     <lb/>All of the pups which were hardly able to walk when we
                     <lb/>left now have the run of the camp. They certainly are a
                     <lb/>nice bunch. <persName>Pappy Gray</persName> has those which he harnesses to
                     <lb/>the airplane sled and drives around. In general the men
                     <lb/>here haven't much to do and take their time doing it.
                     <lb/>The men who have regular schedules to meet such as the
                     <lb/>radio men and the weather man appear at their regular 
                     <lb/>intervals but otherwise any semblance of regularity has
                     <lb/>disappeared. I was puzzled to see such a system of what
                  
               <pb facs="journal-2-09.jpg" n="/e/e04d1ba7-3ba0-4922-b5f4-74690eba7d9f"/>

                  <lb/>we have here now in a system but learned that it
                  <lb/>all came about because the best time for taking
                  <lb/>airplane pictures is in the early morning hours. During
                  <lb/>the flying day when everyone was waiting for breaks in
                  <lb/>the weather this new arrangement of sleeping days and 
                  <lb/>staying up nights became the vogue. We of the biological 
                  <lb/>party are finding it difficult to change from the rigorous
                  <lb/>schedule we have been observing to this not so rigorous
                  <lb/>one of the base.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <lb/>For the first time since we left the base I have
                  <lb/>been really sore in my muscles. I don't know whether
                  <lb/>it is due to the long run made on the last day or to
                  <lb/>the lack of any follow up exercise today.

                  <lb/>All of the radiograms that had come in during my absence

                  <lb/>item of the message, however, lead me to believe that some of my

                  <lb/>died about a week ago. I was very sorry to hear of it <choice><sic>allthough</sic><corr>although</corr></choice>
                  <lb/>I had been expecting it. Evidently his exceptionally strong heart
                  <lb/>just couldn't stand up any longer under the high pressure. It
                  <lb/>is better that he is gone because for several years he has 
                  <lb/>been very unhappy about his condition particularly because he 
                  <lb/>realized that there was no hope of his ever recovering. I
                  <lb/>always enjoyed the moments I spent with him talking
                  <lb/>about boats and travel. I'm certain he would have been

                 <lb/>I had a very difficult time getting up this morning. Although
                 <lb/>I wanted to get up at <time>10</time> it was close to <time>11</time> before I descended
                 <lb/>from my heaven. I dressed and then woke <persName>Tony</persName>. The metabolism
                 <lb/>test did not go off very well and we shall repeat it. We
                 <lb/>finished up just in time for me to take the noon observation
                 <lb/>and change the sheets. In the afternoon I began jumping
                 <lb/>the gas analysis apparatus and after finishing that made an
                 <lb/>end of <title type="book">Death Sails with Magellan</title>. No gun practice today
                 <lb/>After dinner got ready for the <unclear cert="high">usim</unclear> analysis and completed
                 <lb/>my sock washing. Then came the seal chopping chore. The dogs
                 <lb/>sure make a fuss over the seal meat probably because they
                 <lb/>are getting plenty of it. <unclear cert="low">Iut</unclear> brought in the first Adelie
                 <lb/>penguin and <persName>Pete</persName> has been spending most of the evening
                 <lb/>drawing blood and skinning it. There should be more of them
                 <lb/>in one the ice within the next few days. <persName>Asman</persName> and <persName>Pete</persName> took

                 <lb/>but it was no soap. They will have to wait a while longer until
                 <lb/>the surface gets a little harder. <del rend="strikethrough">They</del> The boys don't do much

               <lb/>We have been operating such an erratic schedule and

               <lb/>I have been confused concerning the day and date for

               <lb/>Yesterday which normally would have been written up early
               <lb/>this morning slipped by with no entry entirely because I had
               <lb/>gotten so far into <title>Gone with the Wind</title> that wartime was a thing
               <lb/>of minor importance.  I read that amazing <subst><del rend="strikethrough">epis</del><add place="above">narrative</add></subst> of life
               <lb/>among the Southerners during the <name>Civil War</name> days until almost
               <lb/>AM.  I wasn't reading all of the time but enough of the time 
               <lb/>so that work which should be the main object these days
               <lb/>stagnated.  The book which begins <del rend="strikethrough">I</del> mildly and almost
               <lb/>boringly soon gets under way and its power makes itself
               <lb/>evident.  <region>The South</region> which has been a mystery to me and
               <lb/>no doubt to countless other <name>Americans</name> will soon become in
               <lb/>my mind something more than the land of cotton, belles,
               <lb/>"gentlemen" and mint juleps.  Perhaps even the answer to 
               <lb/>the legendary or hereditary hate most <name>Southerners</name> have 
               <lb/>for <name>Northeners</name> in general would be evident.  At any rate
               <lb/>I felt then that I should get a little American History into

            <p>
               <lb/>my head in an entirely pleasant manner.  Now after
               <lb/>having continued my reading through that part of the book
               <lb/>in which the war has ended and the "Cause" lost <del rend="strikethrough">do</del> I do
               <lb/>begin to get the idea underlying all of the hatred that has
               <lb/>been instilled in the present generation by parents, grand
               <lb/>parents or even great grand parents the latter of whom were
               <lb/>the younger generation of those never-to-be-forgotten days.
               <lb/>If the Yankees had been able to win the war without
               <lb/>the <persName ref="#ANB">Sherman</persName>-in-<placeName ref="#Atlanta">Atlanta</placeName> episode perhaps all of the
               <lb/>stigma which now is attached <del rend="strikethrough">th</del>to the word Northener
               <lb/>might have been avoided.  Conerning the <name>Civil War</name> no
               <lb/>one can say "that's all ancient History" because in
               <lb/>the South, as far as I can gather from some of the Southern boys
               <lb/>here, the <name type="event">Civil War</name> is still being fought with almost the 
               <lb/>same intensity as in the days of the actual war itself.  I
               <lb/>am now about to embark on the history of the post war days
               <lb/>which are to be considered as bad if not worse than <del>those</del>
               <lb/>the war days themselves.

               <lb/>Last night part of the time was spent analyzing air
               <lb/>samples that had been taken outside. The interesting part
               <lb/>of this work was the very low percentage of oxygen in the air
               <lb/>the carbon dioxide value which was relatively quite high
               <lb/>was not as accurate a result as the oxygen value so cannot

                  <lb/>samples I am cooperating with <persName>Court</persName> the meteorologist who
                  <lb/>tells me when to take the samples. The prime requisite is
                  <lb/>that the wind must have been blowing steadily from one
                  <lb/>direction for more than six hours. I shall do as many
                  <lb/>of these analyses as time and energy — mostly energy — will
                  <lb/>permit. When correlated with the weather data <persName>Court</persName> has they
                  <lb/>should be of some value to whomever studies that sort of
                  <lb/>thing. My interest in the matter lies only in the fact that
                  <lb/>I may be the only man for some time to come who will have
                  <lb/>an accurate apparatus for gas analysis here in the <placeName>Antarctic</placeName>.

                  <lb/>I tried to get some shots at skua gulls with the hand

                  <lb/>I couldn't get close enough to shoot. I shall have to learn

               <lb/>meets men from many walks of life and learns quickly
               <lb/>to adjust oneself to meet each personality. One learns
               <lb/>the meaning of work and what a working man thinks 
               <lb/>about the type of work not requiring a strong back and 
               <lb/>plenty of perspiration. One learns many new handicrafts

               <lb/>of men who might be <unclear cert="low">chrosed</unclear> as <unclear cert="medium">masters</unclear> of their <unclear cert="low">cots</unclear>. If one

               <lb/>art of living among the elements and on only the bare necessities
               <lb/>one acquires a confidence, an assurance and an interest <!-- confident about the word, but it has some larger gaps or spaces in between letters -->
               <lb/>in things utterly foreign to one's early training and profits
               <lb/>according to one's ability to absorb and retain. Many small

                <lb/>Until the ships arrive, the days will be quite the same
                <lb/>only occasional variation will relieve the monotony which is 
                <lb/>heightened because the <unclear cert="high">hour</unclear> of departure is indeed not far off. 
                <lb/>The variety of today's <unclear reason="script" cert="high">routine</unclear> was the trip I took with the dogs
                <lb/>down to <placeName>the Bay</placeName>. After dinner I got <unclear cert="high"><persName>Tony</persName></unclear> to help me haul

                <lb/>ski ahead and make a trail so that the team would follow
                <lb/>but the team went right by him. I stopped and he joined 
                <lb/>Court in the shed giving me a load of about <num type="cardinal">300</num> <measure>lbs</measure>. The dogs

                 <lb/>and as we headed toward it we saw <persName><name type="nickname">Pappy</name>Greg</persName> in the

                 <lb/>down to the barrels. We parked the teams and went to the

            <p>
                 <lb/>We finally headed for home with my dogs leading.

                 <lb/>consists of <title type="no-fictionalbook">Homo <unclear cert="low">enows</unclear></title> by <persName>Darwin</persName> a discussion of <persName>Darwin</persName>
                 <lb/>then most recent book <title type="non-fictionalbook">The Descent of Man</title>. I bought the former
                 <lb/>in <placeName>New Zealand</placeName> to accompany the latter which I have at home
            </p>
            <p>
                 <lb/>It was <time>three AM</time> before I turned out the light. I was
                 <lb/>fearful for my early rising but I didn't have anything particular
                 <lb/>to do tomorrow so I <!--Here the word I looks like it was added in after the words arounf it--> can sleep in if I feel that way.

                  <lb/>As I expected I didn't get up very early. I woke up at
                  <lb/>930 and thought I would lie there until 10 but I fell

                  <lb/>After doing an air sample I read most of the afternoon
                  <lb/>I am learning a great deal from <title level="m" ref="Stefansson">Hunters of the Great North</title>
                  <lb/>and was especially please to come <del rend="strikethrough">a pa</del> across a passage
                  <lb/>on dog driving which was my theory of dog driving in black
                  <lb/>and white; it goes as follows. page 118. <quote>"The Eskimo idea
                  <lb/>was that a dog should be treated with great consideration, and
                  <lb/>his opinion was that a good dog would pull about as long as he
                  <lb/>has any strength without being whipped. . . . that the only
                  <lb/>approved Eskimo method of inducing dogs to work is either by
                  <lb/>shouting to them and trying to cheer them up by <supplied reason="omitted from the transcription of the source">the</supplied> voice, or else
                  <lb/>by having some person walk ahead of the team of whom the dogs
                  <lb/>are so fond that they will pull hard to try to keep up. I
                  <lb/>regret to say that during the twelve years following 1906 the
                  <lb/><placeName>Mackenzie River</placeName> Eskimos adopted the custom of whipping dogs.<del>"</del>
                  <lb/>. . . . that whipping tired dogs was one of the white man's

                  <lb/>agree whole heartedly with this. I do whip a lead
                  <lb/>dog when he won't keep his line tight but only enough to
                  <lb/>convince the dog that he is doing something wrong. These
                  <lb/>dogs are so intelligent that they know when they aren't
                  <lb/>working as they should. I never beat a dog and never
                  <lb/>hit one hard enough to lame it or make it sore.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <lb/>As a governor on my impatience I usually use my hand
               <pb facs="journal-2-30" n="/3/3e5d8217-95b3-4431-b19b-f90dd2b900ec"/>

                  <lb/>knowing that I won't hit hard enought to hurt my hand.
                  <lb/>One day, however, <name type="dog" ref="#Sheila">Sheila</name> tried to bite me when I was
                  <lb/>freeing her from the gang line and I really laced into
                  <lb/>her. Biting is one thing that should never be tolerated in
                  <lb/>dogs. Sometimes when I have boxed <name type="dog" ref="#Spot">Spot</name>'s ears he has
                  <lb/>reached up and taken my gloved hand but to show he
                  <lb/>was only protesting my action he never closed down
               </p>
               <p>
                  <lb/>I have noticed several times the pups which are running
                  <lb/>loose, would try to steal a piece of meat from one of the tethered
                  <lb/>dogs. The true viciousness of the large dogs immediately comes
                  <lb/>out and luckily for the small dogs they scamper away but only
                  <lb/>in the nick of time. I should hate to say what would happen
                  <lb/>to a pup should a dog like <name type="dog" ref="#Spot">Spot</name> get a good grip on it when
                  <lb/>no one was around.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <lb/>I am trying to train <name type="dog" ref="#Spot">Spot</name> not to touch his meat until
                  <lb/>I tell him to. He does very well and lets me take meat
                  <lb/>away from him after he has started to eat. He is really
                  <lb/>a good dog. I sent a message to <persName>Beatie</persName> telling her
                  <lb/>to feed <persName>Pete</persName> well because I was bringing a 90 lb dog
                  <lb/>home. Just wait until they see him.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <lb/>This evening we had a reshow of <title level="m" ref="#Blondie">Blondie</title> which made

                 <lb/>Things have been happening around here so rapidly
                 <lb/>that I haven't been able to find time even to sit down

              </p>
              <p>
                 <lb/>Today at 8 PM we hear that the <name type="ship">Bear</name> was
                 <lb/>only 190 miles from <geogName>the Bay</geogName> and with clear sailing
                 <lb/>should be in tomorrow afternoon about 6 PM. <persName>Jack</persName> and
                 <lb/><persName>Doug</persName> have taken a trail tent down to the barrier and
                 <lb/>are spending the nigth there. I doubt, however, that they

                 <lb/>really be able to come in because the ice hasn't gone
                 <lb/>out yet. We <del rend="strikethrough"><unclear>not</unclear></del> may have a job loading stuff but

              <p>
                 <lb/>The weather was good enough today so that the
                 <lb/><rs>Beechcraft</rs> was able to make two flights out to the <name type="aircraft">Conder</name>.

              <p>
                 <lb/>During the past three days I have been making
                 <lb/>daily runs down to the <hi rend="underlined">old ca</hi>che  to pick up a seal and
                 <lb/>bring it back to camp. Twelve seal have been killed so far
                 <lb/>and about 6 have been brought back. Today while
                 <lb/>I was down onn the bay ice having parked the team up
                 <lb/>above on the barrier my companions, <persName>Tony</persName> <persName><addName type="nickname">Doc</addName></persName> and <persName>Joe
                 <lb/>Wells</persName>, and I were disturbed in our picture taking and
                 <pb facs="journal-2-32" n="/1/10894952-c9d4-42f8-bd1b-9ef6df38aca7"/>

                 <lb/>fun with the seals by the noise of a dog fight. We
                 <lb/>hurried up and found the team had moved about 
                 <lb/>100 yards and that most of the dogs were all tangled
                 <lb/>up. After straightening them up I found <name type="dog">Shippy</name>
                 <lb/>tangled up in his harness and a sorry looking mess
                 <lb/>he had a bad gash under his left forearm and was
                 <lb/>in such poor shape although alive that if <persName>Joe</persName> had
                 <lb/>had any shells left in the 45 I should have put him
                 <lb/>out of his misery right then. I tied him on the sled and
                 <lb/>had <persName>Tony</persName>hold him while we made the trip back to camp.
                 <lb/>After arrival at camp I went in to get a revolver and shells
                 <lb/>and told <persName><unclear>Siple</unclear></persName> that I was going to shoot the dog. He
                 <lb/>wanted me to get <persName>Dick's</persName> opinion on the dog's condition. When
                 <lb/><persName>Dick</persName> saw him he said he had seen dogs in worse condition
                 <lb/>and that I sould let <name type="dog">Shippy</name> stay in the <unclear>machine</unclear> shop
                 <lb/>for a while I really didn't want to do this because
                 <lb/><name type="dog">Shippy</name>had been a good dog, had done his work well and
                 <lb/>probably would be okay if he lived to reach the states.
                 <lb/>I would rather shoot my dogs there than subject them to a
                 <lb/>sea voyage none of them likes because most of them are
                 <lb/>not pets and most likely will be done away with later on.
                 <lb/>Well, I left him in the <unclear>medicine</unclear>shop until after dinner
                 <lb/>when he began throwing up. I spoke to <persName>Dick</persName>again and
                 <lb/>he said since it was my dog I could do whatever I
                 <lb/>wanted with him. I took him out to the wind <unclear>moa</unclear>
                 <lb/>around the old <unclear>cedar</unclear><unclear>ha</unclear>and gave him two shots
                 <lb/><persName>Troy</persName>accompanied me to see his old friend die a death
                 <pb facs="journal 2-33" n="/4/44478c9d-f855-48a0-9d1b-0bff2c740f8d"/>

                 <lb/>probably more humane than any of the other dogs would get.
                 <lb/>As we watched him after the shot had been fired his
                 <lb/>tail wagged a few times and we thought he must 
                 <lb/>be enjoying a whole seal in dog heaven. Without 
                 <lb/>doubt <name type="dog">Shippy</name>will live in my mind long after the
                 <lb/>others have become faded memories. He well deserves
                 <lb/>it because he was one of my best dogs. 
              </p>
              <p>
                 <lb/>The tractor party came back Monday morning about 
                 <lb/>7AM. They made a <unclear>min o tap</unclear>dash in from 90. <unclear>fantastically</unclear>
                 <lb/>for our party they brought in with them our dog sled with
                 <lb/>all our extra gear on it. 
              </p>
              <p>
                 <lb/>The dog team party came in Tuesday morning. They
                 <lb/>they had camped at <placeName>Fort Wiener</placeName> Monday night but left
                 <lb/>at 3AM Tuesday morning. The <unclear>survey</unclear> party came in first
                 <lb/>about 9AM. <persName>Ike Schlossback</persName> was the last man in. All
                 <lb/>all of them looked as crumby as our party did when we 
                 <lb/>arrived. 
              </p>
              <p>
                 <lb/>Now that everyone is in and the trail season is over
                 <lb/>this <unclear>loosens</unclear> our Party's <unclear>moods.</unclear> A lot of <persName>Fitz's</persName> gear, two

              </p>
              <p>
                 <lb/>I shall take Fitz in the <unclear>bashel</unclear> tomorrow for the start
                 <lb/>in the trail parties. There are only 6 men I want to get

                <lb/>Day of days. The <name type="ship">Bear</name> has came in.

             <p>
                <lb/>I didn't get to bed until about 6 that morning. <persName>Arnold</persName> wanted 
                <lb/>me to do our <unclear>andyin</unclear> he thought would be continental air
                <lb/>he thought I might take a sample and do the analysis tomorrow
                <lb/>but since I have only one <unclear>willching</unclear> bottle and I needed that for
                <lb/>this morning. I had to finish the analysis almost immediately. 
                <lb/>In the meantime I took a bath. Wonder of wonders! Actually
                <lb/>I think I was ashamed into it, by the way the boys who came
                <lb/>in from the trail meticulously removed the layers of dirt that had
                <lb/>accumulated while vacationing in the mountains.
             </p>
             <p>
                <lb/>After doing the analysis I went to bed for a few hours and

             <p>
                <lb/>About four o'clok the <name type="ship">Bear</name> came in on the radio and said

                <lb/>up when I arrived on the <unclear>ceene</unclear> at quarter of five. After the

               <p>
                  <lb/>The wind had come up during the night and

                  <lb/>also means that we may have an easier time loading
                  <lb/>than was expected.

               <p>
                  <lb/>I read the reports of the expedition that have been
                  <lb/>published in various newspapers and reprinted in the <date>March</date>
                  <lb/>issue of the <title>Polar Times</title>. I have never seen such a 
                  <lb/>mess of rubbish collected together in one small volume in
                  <lb/>my life. It was all "the Admiral this" and "<persName>Byrd</persName> that"
                  <lb/>No matter where the airplanes flew the mountains they saw
                  <lb/>had been previously "discovered" by <persName>Byrd</persName>. One clipping
                  <lb/>also stated that the admiral made flights and took
                  <lb/>pictures enough "to map accurately" about <measure>35000</measure> sq.
                  <lb/>miles of <emph style="underline">new</emph> territory. We all know that they only
         <pb facs="journal-2-38.jpg" n="/2/29660762-216a-434c-97a1-f246fa4f8e8c"/>
         <fw type="pageNum" place="top">34</fw> 
                <lb/>camera taken on those flights was a Leica and no
                <lb/>attempt was made to make overlaps or circles of pictures.
                <lb/>It is doubtful whether the admiral knew accurately where
                <lb/>he was. The reports said he discovered new mountains
                <lb/><num>300</num> miles from here and we know that there are no 
                <lb/><emph style="underline">new</emph> mountains within <num>300</num> miles of the base. <sic>in</sic>fact the
                <lb/>plows had to tax their range to the limit to get into
                <lb/>new territory.  Our trail party was <num>300</num> miles from the
                <lb/>base and we didn't see any mountains that had never
                <lb/>been seen before. The blarney that was written about
                <lb/>the dangers we faced while unloading was exaggerated
                <lb/>so much that we wondered if we were on the same
                <lb/>expedition. It was hoped by all hands that since this
                <lb/>was a government expedition all of the exaggeration and
                <lb/>untruths would be cut out of the reports.  We feel that
                <lb/>the type of publicity so necessary to a private expedition
                <lb/><del rend="strikethrough">was</del>is absolutely unnecessary for this expedition.  However,
                <lb/>since <persName>Byrd</persName> seems to be the only one who is getting credit
                <lb/>for all the work done down here even though he has 
                <lb/>had actually little to do with the goings on, it must
                <lb/>be he and his stooge <persName>Hawthorne</persName> who have contrived to
                <lb/>keep the exaggerations and untruths on the same high
                <lb/>plane as maintained on previous expeditions. <persName>Hawthorne</persName>
                <lb/>who is coming down in the <name type="ship">Star</name> presumably to collect
                <lb/>film journals diaries etc is suspected of having his

                <lb/>Admiral--and consequently will have little cooperation
