                     University and Director of Digital Media Studies in the Department of English.
                     He has edited <title level="m">The Minutes of the Aberdeen Philosophical Society, 1758–1773</title>
                     (Aberdeen University Press, 1990) and, with Dennis Quon, “Semiotics in
                     Eighteenth-century Aberdeen: Thomas Gordon’s Contributions to the Aberdeen
                     Philosophical Society” (<title level="m">Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth-Century</title> 317
                     (1994): 57–115). He is also the author of <title level="m">Things, Thoughts, Words and Actions:
                     The Problem of Language in Late Eighteenth-Century British Rhetorical Theory</title>
                     (Southern Illinois University Press, 1994). Since 2005, he has worked with
                     undergraduate and graduate students in textual editing courses to create a
                     series of electronic textual editions of nineteenth- and early
                     twentieth-century American manuscripts in the Rare Books and Manuscripts
                     Library at Ohio State. An example of that work can be viewed online at
                     http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/ulman1/SSCoxJournal/. Beginning with an NEH
                     Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant awarded in 2008, he has collaborated with
                     Melanie Schlosser, metadata librarian at Ohio State University Libraries, to
                     build a model of preservation for distributed, multimodal digital humanities
                     projects. He is delighted to be working at a time when manuscript, print, and
                     digital media can be studied in relationship to one another, allowing him and
                     his students to learn more about all three media than they could by studying
                     any one in isolation.</note>

               editions of previously unpublished nineteenth-century American manuscripts held in
               the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at The Ohio State University. Previous
               editions include "My Dear Elizabeth," five letters written by Sophia Peabody
               Hawthorne to her sister Elizabeth Palmer Peabody between ca. 1837 and 1868 (currently
               being revised); "Dear Wife," twenty-one letters written by riverboat captain William
               B. Anderson to his wife Louisa while he plied the Ohio river during the height of the
               American Civil War, 1862&#x2013;1864; "Journal of a Tour to Europe," by Samuel Sullivan Cox;
               and "Louisa A. Doane's Journal of Two Ocean Voyages (1852-1853). These documentary
               editions are intended to provide wide exposure and access to manuscripts that might
               otherwise be difficult for scholars to discover and consult, and to provide users
               with a variety of tools for studying those texts. </p>
            <p>Each text was edited in connection with an undergraduate or graduate course offered
               by H. Lewis Ulman, Associate Professor of English at The Ohio State University. The
               courses provide students with an opportunity to explore issues of textuality
               and mediation that arise when our cultural archives spread from page to screen and
               from library shelves to networked databases. Electronic textual editing serves as our
               vehicle for examining what happens—and envisioning what might happen—when artifacts
               in one medium are represented in another medium, especially with regard to the
               interpretive work of reading. Electronic textual editions also provide a contact zone
               that can help us reflect on what manuscript, print, and "born digital" artifacts can
               tell us about their unique properties and their relationships to one another.</p>
            <p>While providing a reliable textual edition is a <foreign xml:lang="lat">sine qua
                  non</foreign>, the Lockhart edition also explores ways of telling four stories
               inextricably woven into our work: the lives and historical milieu evoked by the
               texts, the history of the physical journal, the
               editorial process that gave rise to this particular interpretation of the text, and
               the mediation of our electronic delivery system. </p>

               <emph rend="bold">Scanning</emph>. The manuscript pages were scanned as 24-bit TIFF
               images at 400 dots per inch (dpi), then coverted to 8-bit JPEG images at 400 dpi and
               full quality before being loaded into the Media Manager application. All edges were
               overscanned by at least 1/4 inch. No color correction was used at any stage of image
               preparation, but a scan of a photographer's 18% grey card on the same scanner
               produced RGB values at the center of 91/95/107 after applying a 150% Gaussian Blur in
               Adobe Photoshop to average color values. Thus, a properly configured monitor should
               provide a reasonable approximation of colors on the manuscript pages.

               <emph rend="bold">Markup of Physical Structure and Page Layout</emph>. The manuscript
                  <emph rend="bold">pages</emph>, encoded by the empty page break or &lt;pb/&gt;
               element, are the primary physical structures represented in the markup. Each
               &lt;pb&gt; element includes a &quot;facs&quot; attribute identifying the unique ID of
               a high-resolution scan of that image in the Media Manager application. <emph
                  rend="bold">Line breaks</emph> (i.e., lineation determined or influenced by the
               physical constraints of the page rather than compositional choices by the author) are
               encoded with the empty &lt;lb/&gt; element. No attributes are included in the
               &lt;lb&gt; element. Because Smith wrote on lined paper, when he skips a line printed
               on the paper for any reason, we encode a &lt;lb/&gt; that, in the view arranged by
               manuscript pages and lines, will appear as an empty numbered line. </p>
            <p>
               <emph rend="bold">Markup of Textual Structure</emph>. The <emph rend="bold">diary
                  entry</emph>, encoded by a &lt;div&gt; element with the attribute-value pair
               &quot;type='Entry'&quot;, constitutes the primary textual structure represented in
               the markup. Each entry contains a
               &lt;dateline&gt; element and one or more paragraphs. Each dateline may include a
               &lt;name&gt; element with (optionally) a @type attribute containing one of
               the following values: city, region; and a &lt;date&gt; element with a
               @when attribute whose value is in the form YYYY-MM-DD. The value of the
               @when attribute represents the editors' judgment about the actual date when the entry
               was composed; the contents of the &lt;date&gt; element represent what Smith actually
               wrote, even if he entered the date incorrectly.
            </p>
            <p>
               Entries consist of a series of <emph rend="bold">paragraphs</emph>. Where indicated
               by context, indentation of a line from the left margin of a page, line breaks part-way across
               a page, or additional white space between lines, paragraphs are encoded with the
               &lt;p&gt; element and no attributes.
            </p>
            <p>
               If present, any prefatory text preceding the dateline may be encoded as a
               &lt;head&gt; element at the beginning of an entry (i.e., within the
               &lt;div&gt;element and before the &lt;dateline&gt;).
            </p>
            <p>
               <emph rend="bold">Level of Transcription/Encoding</emph>. This markup scheme supports
               a modest range of presentations, from semi-modernized/corrected to semi-diplomatic.
               The basic transcription follows the manuscript verbatim. Various manuscript features
               (e.g., cancellations, interlinear or marginal additions, tears in pages) are encoded,
               as are regularized versions of proper names and dates and standard versions of
               nonstandard spellings and expansions of abbreviations. </p>

               <emph rend="bold">Customization of the TEI P5 Schema</emph>. Customization consisted primarily of restricting
               encoding to certain modules and elements as well as enforcing some attribute values. See the ODD file for 
               complete details.

                  <lb/><placeName>Fort Wiener</placeName> at 930 PM and at 11 PM when we were
                  <lb/>only 10.5 miles from <rs>the base</rs> decided not to camp until
                  <lb/>morning but push on in. <del rend="strikethrough">Tony and the <unclear>rest</unclear></del> While we were
                  <lb/>resting we drank a toast to ourselves — as a party — and
                  <lb/>to a merry christmas, finishing up the half a pint which
                  <lb/>I had nursed along so carefully for two and a half months. <persName>Tony</persName>
                  <lb/>and I started out again and again and for a while had some
                  <lb/>difficulty staying ahead of the dogs. They were running now
                  <lb/>just as well as they did when we first hit the good

                  <lb/>that we should never have made the base when we did.
                  <lb/>if we hadn't combinded our teams. As one o'clock we
                  <lb/>could just see the base and the airplane looming on the

                     <lb/>PM and works preparing the <unclear>only</unclear> meal of the day a dinner

                     <lb/>6-7-8 in the morning. The only work being done around camp
                     <lb/>is <unclear>general</unclear> duty and evacuation work- not much of the latter

                  <lb/>we have here now in a system but learned that it

                  <lb/>For the first time since we left the base I have
                  <lb/>been really sore in my muscles. I don't know whether
                  <lb/>it is due to the long run made on the last day or to

                  <lb/>I had been expecting it. Evidently his exceptionally strong heart

                  <lb/>is better that he is gone because for several years he has

                  <lb/>about boats and travel. I'm certain he would have been

               <lb/>We have been operating such an erratic schedule and

               <lb/>I have been confused concerning the day and date for

               <lb/>Yesterday which normally would have been written up early
               <lb/>this morning slipped by with no entry entirely because I had
               <lb/>gotten so far into <title>Gone with the Wind</title> that wartime was a thing
               <lb/>of minor importance.  I read that amazing <subst><del rend="strikethrough">epis</del><add place="above">narrative</add></subst> of life
               <lb/>among the Southerners during the Civil War days until almost
               <lb/>AM.  I wasn't reading all of the time but enough of the time 
               <lb/>so that work which should be the main object these days
               <lb/>stagnated.  The book which begins <del rend="strikethrough">I</del> mildly and almost
               <lb/>boringly soon gets under way and its power makes itself
               <lb/>evident.  The South which has been a mystery to me and
               <lb/>no doubt to countless other Americans will soon become in
               <lb/>my mind something more than the land of cotton, belles,
               <lb/>"gentlemen" and mint juleps.  Perhaps even the answer to 
               <lb/>the legendary or hereditary hate most Southerners have 
               <lb/>for Northeners in general would be evident.  At any rate

               <lb/>my head in an entirely pleasant manner.  Now after

               <lb/>in which the war has ended and the "Cause" lost <del rend="strikethrough">do</del> I do
               <lb/>begin to get the idea underlying all of the hatred that has

               <lb/>might have been avoided.  Conerning the Civil War no
               <lb/>one can say "that's all ancient History" because in
               <lb/>the South, as far as I can gather from some of the Southern boys
               <lb/>here, the Civil War is still being fought with almost the 
               <lb/>same intensity as in the days of the actual war itself.  I
               <lb/>am now about to embark on the history of the post war days
               <lb/>which are to be considered as bad if not worse than <del>those</del>

               <lb/>Last night part of the time was spent analyzing air
               <lb/>samples that had been taken outside. The interesting part
               <lb/>of this work was the very low percentage of oxygen in the air
               <lb/>the carbon dioxide value which was relatively quite high
               <lb/>was not as accurate a result as the oxygen value so cannot

                  <lb/>tells me when to take the samples. The prime requisite is
                  <lb/>that the wind must have been blowing steadily from one
                  <lb/>direction for more than six hours. I shall do as many
                  <lb/>of these analyses as time and energy — mostly energy — will
                  <lb/>permit. When correlated with the weather data <persName>Court</persName> has they
                  <lb/>should be of some value to whomever studies that sort of
                  <lb/>thing. My interest in the matter lies only in the fact that

                  <lb/>signal came through strongly enough for rebroadcasting.
                  <lb/>The signal strength held only for a few minutes <gap rend="overwritten"/>and not
                  <lb/>long enough for our choral singing to take place. At
                  <lb/>the last minute almost a few of us worked out the words
                  <lb/>to Auld Lang Syne and Show Me the Way to Go Home. None
                  <lb/>of us knew all of both songs completely. <persName>Pete</persName> was to
